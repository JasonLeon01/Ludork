 # Ludork: 2D RPG Toolkit - Help Manual
 ## Configuration Reference

 This chapter summarizes the most important configuration fields you will encounter when working with Ludork Projects. It focuses on the system configuration file and related settings that affect the game’s appearance and behavior.

 Configuration files live under your Project’s `Data/Configs` directory and are edited through dedicated windows in the editor.

 ### System Configuration

 The system configuration file (commonly named `System.json`) defines core visual and runtime settings. Typical fields include:

 - `title`  
   - Type: string  
   - Description: The game’s title, used in window captions and UI where applicable.

 - `gameSize`  
   - Type: int[2]  
   - Description: The game’s resolution in pixels, usually `[width, height]`.

 - `fonts`  
   - Type: file[] (base: `Fonts/`)  
   - Description: A list of font files available to the game, stored in the Fonts folder.

 - `fontSize`  
   - Type: int  
   - Description: The default font size for in‑game text.

 - `icon`  
   - Type: file (base: `System/`)  
   - Description: The main window or application icon, usually a `.png` file.

 - `windowskinName`  
   - Type: file (base: `System/`)  
   - Description: The window skin image used for message boxes, menus, and other UI windows.

 - `windowColor`  
   - Type: int[4]  
   - Description: The RGBA color applied to UI windows, typically `[R, G, B, A]`.

 - `cellSize`  
   - Type: int  
   - Description: The base tile size in pixels; this should match the tileset definitions used by your maps.

 - `transitionShaderPath`  
   - Type: file (base: `Shaders/`)  
   - Description: Shader file used for scene transitions (fades, wipes, etc.).

 - `materialShaderPath`  
   - Type: file (base: `Shaders/`)  
   - Description: Shader file used for material or lighting‑style effects.

 - `vagueShaderPath`  
   - Type: file (base: `Shaders/`)  
   - Description: Shader file used for blur‑style or soft focus effects.

 - `toneShaderPath`  
   - Type: file (base: `Shaders/`)  
   - Description: Shader file used to adjust scene tone (color balance, brightness, etc.).

 - `grayScaleShaderPath`  
   - Type: file (base: `Shaders/`)  
   - Description: Shader file used to render grayscale effects.

 - `type`  
   - Type: string  
   - Description: A marker that identifies the configuration type (for example, `"system"`).

 These fields work together to define the core look and feel of your game.

 ### Editing Configurations in the Editor

 While configuration files are stored as JSON or similar formats, you normally edit them through the editor:
 - Open the configuration window from the main menu or toolbar.
 - Adjust values such as game size, fonts, shaders, and window appearance.
 - Save your changes; the editor writes updated values back to the configuration files under `Data/Configs`.

 After changing configuration values, you can:
 - Use the preview features to see how the game looks with the new settings.
 - Run the game to verify that resolutions, fonts, and shaders behave as expected.

 ### Other Configuration Files

 In addition to the system configuration, your Project may include other configuration files under `Data/Configs`, for example:
 - Gameplay parameter files.
 - Audio or input settings.
 - Project‑specific options that influence custom systems.

 The exact structure of these files depends on how your Project is set up. As a general rule:
 - Use the editor’s configuration tools where available.
 - Keep configuration changes under version control or backups so you can revert if needed.

 Understanding these configuration fields helps ensure that maps, UI, and effects behave consistently across your Project and in the final packaged game.
