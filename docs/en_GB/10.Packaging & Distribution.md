 # Ludork: 2D RPG Toolkit - Help Manual
 ## Packaging & Distribution

 This chapter outlines how to package your Ludork Project into a build that players can run without the editor. The details of the underlying build process are handled by the tools that ship with Ludork; as a creator, you interact mainly through the editor’s packaging interface.

 ### Packaging Goals

 When you package a Project, you want to:
 - Produce a standalone application or game folder that contains the runtime engine and your Project data.
 - Include all required resources (Data, Assets, configuration, and locale files).
 - Exclude development‑only files where possible.

 Ludork’s packaging tools take care of bundling the necessary components based on your Project.

 ### Packaging from the Editor

 The editor provides commands or dialogs for packaging your Project, often under a menu or toolbar entry such as **Pack** or **Build**. The general flow is:
 - Make sure your Project is in a consistent state (maps, configs, and Common Functions saved).
 - Open the packaging dialog from the editor.
 - Choose the target platform or packaging mode where applicable.
 - Start the build.

 Behind the scenes, the packaging process:
 - Collects your Project’s data and assets.
 - Bundles them together with the runtime engine.
 - Produces an output in a build or distribution directory.

 The exact options available may vary by platform and Ludork version, but the editor is designed so that you do not need to run build scripts manually for typical use.

 ### Output and Contents

 After packaging, you can expect an output folder or application that includes:
 - The Ludork runtime and any required libraries.
 - Your Project’s `Data/` directory.
 - Your Project’s asset folders (images, audio, shaders, fonts, etc.).
 - Locale and configuration files needed at runtime.

 You can test the packaged build by:
 - Running the generated executable or launcher.
 - Confirming that maps, audio, and effects work as they did inside the editor.

 If anything is missing, check:
 - That your assets are stored in the expected folders.
 - That configuration fields point to the correct paths.

 ### Iterating on Builds

 Packaging is not a one‑time step. A typical loop is:
 - Edit content in the editor and test using the built‑in preview.
 - When you reach a stable state, create a packaged build.
 - Test the packaged build on the target platform.
 - Return to the editor to fix issues or polish content, then create a new build.

 Keeping your Project structure consistent and assets well‑organized helps the packaging process run smoothly and reduces surprises in the final build.
