 ## Tilesets & Map Editing

 This chapter focuses on how you build the visual layout of your game using **tilesets** and **maps**. Tilesets provide the raw building blocks; maps assemble those tiles into playable areas.

 ### Tilesets Overview

 A **tileset** is a collection of tiles packed into one or more images. Each tile is a small, equally sized square or rectangle that represents:
 - A piece of terrain (grass, water, walls, roads).
 - A decorative detail (plants, furniture, props).
 - A functional element (doors, switches, ladders).

 Tilesets allow you to reuse the same graphics across many maps, while still controlling how each tile behaves in the game.

 Conceptually, each tileset definition contains:
 - A reference to one or more tileset images in your Project’s asset folder.
 - The tile size (for example, 32×32 pixels).
 - Per‑tile properties such as whether the tile is passable or blocks movement.

 ### Opening the Tileset Editor

 To work with tilesets:
 - Open your Project in the editor.
 - Use the project/file panels to locate tileset data under the Project’s `Data/Tilesets` area.
 - Open a tileset entry to bring up the **Tileset Editor**.

 The Tileset Editor typically displays:
 - The tileset images as a grid of tiles.
 - Controls for choosing tile size and other tileset‑wide options.
 - A way to inspect and adjust properties for individual tiles or groups of tiles.

 ### Creating a New Tileset

 To create a new tileset for your Project:
 - Start from the tileset management area in the editor.
 - Create a new tileset entry.
 - Choose a tileset image from your Project’s asset folder (for example, from a folder dedicated to tileset images).
 - Set the tile size so the grid aligns with the image.

 After that, you can:
 - Give the tileset a descriptive name.
 - Save it so it appears as a reusable tileset in the map editor.

 The editor stores the tileset definition under `Data/Tilesets` and references the image by path, without copying the file.

 ### Tile Properties

 Beyond simply selecting tiles, you can define behavior by assigning properties. Common examples include:
 - **Passability**: whether characters can walk over the tile or are blocked by it.
 - **Layering or draw order hints**: whether the tile appears below or above characters.
 - **Special tags or categories**: for example, marking tiles as water, lava, or region-specific zones.

 In the Tileset Editor, you typically:
 - Select one or more tiles in the grid.
 - Adjust their properties via a panel or toolbar.
 - Save the tileset so maps that use it pick up the updated behavior.

 These settings are stored as part of the tileset data and interpreted by the runtime engine when the game runs.

 ### Maps Overview

 A **map** is a 2D layout built from one or more tilesets. It defines:
 - The size of the playable area (width and height in tiles).
 - Which tiles appear at each position on each layer.
 - Additional metadata such as region information or light sources.

 Maps are central to building levels, towns, dungeons, and any other navigable space in your game.

 ### Creating and Opening Maps

 To create a new map:
 - Open the map management area in the editor.
 - Create a new map entry and specify its dimensions.
 - Choose which tilesets the map will use.

 To edit an existing map:
 - Locate it under the Project’s map data in the file explorer.
 - Open it to display the map editor in the central workspace.

 The map editor loads both the map data and its associated tilesets so you can start painting immediately.

 ### Map Editor Basics

 The map editor is organized around two main areas:
 - A **tileset area**, where you select tiles or tile regions to use as a brush.
 - A **map area**, where you paint those tiles onto the map grid.

 Common operations in the map editor include:
 - Clicking or dragging in the tileset area to select a tile or rectangle of tiles.
 - Painting tiles in the map area with a pencil, rectangle, or fill‑style tool.
 - Erasing or replacing tiles.
 - Switching between layers (for example, ground, decorations, overhead elements).

 The editor provides visual feedback as you move the cursor, helping you see which tile will be placed and where.

 ### Layers and Depth

 Maps often use multiple layers to separate different kinds of content:
 - **Base layers** for terrain and walkable surfaces.
 - **Decoration layers** for trees, rocks, furniture, and other details.
 - **Upper layers** for elements that appear above characters (e.g., canopies, balconies).

 In the editor, you can:
 - Select which layer is active for painting.
 - Hide or show layers to focus on specific aspects of the map.
 - Reorder layers where supported, to change draw order and depth.

 The runtime engine uses this layer information to determine which tiles render in front of or behind characters.

 ### Using Tileset Properties in Maps

 Tileset properties directly influence how maps behave at runtime. For example:
 - Tiles marked as non‑passable will block character movement on any map that uses them.
 - Tiles with special tags may be used by gameplay logic (such as triggering events or determining movement cost).

 Because the same tileset can be reused across multiple maps:
 - Changing a tile’s properties in the tileset can affect every map that uses that tile.
 - This makes it easy to tune behavior consistently across your Project.

 When adjusting tileset properties, keep in mind which maps are already using the tiles, especially in large Projects.

 ### Additional Map Data

 Beyond tiles themselves, maps may include additional data, such as:
 - Region definitions for encounter zones or special rules.
 - Light sources and environmental effects.
 - Placement of actors, interactive objects, or markers used by gameplay logic.

 These are typically edited through specialized tools or panels within the map editor. While tiles define the visual layout, this additional data defines how the map behaves in the game.
