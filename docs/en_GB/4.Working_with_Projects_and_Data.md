 # Ludork: 2D RPG Toolkit - Help Manual
 ## Working with Projects & Data

 This chapter explains how Ludork organizes project data and how you work with it in everyday use. The focus is on the structure of a project, where different kinds of information live, and what happens when you create, open, and save content.

 In this context, a **Project** is a self-contained folder that holds:
 - All structured data required by the engine (maps, tilesets, configuration, visual scripts).
 - All media assets used by the game (images, audio, fonts, shaders, system graphics).

 ### Project Overview

 When you open a Project in Ludork, the editor:
 - Treats the selected folder as the **project root**.
 - Reads its data and asset subfolders to populate the file lists, editors, and preview panels.
 - Keeps track of which maps, tilesets, configuration files, and Common Functions are currently open.

 As you work:
 - Changes you make in different editors are kept in memory.
 - When you save, they are written back into files under the Project root.
 - The runtime engine later reads the same files to run the game.

 You can think of a Project as the single source of truth for your game’s content.

 ### Project Structure

 Ludork uses a consistent layout within a Project so that both the editor and the runtime know where to find information. A typical Project includes:
 - A **Data** folder for structured game data.
 - An **Assets** folder (or similar) for media resources.
 - Optional auxiliary files such as project-level configuration or metadata.

 While exact naming can vary, the following conventions are common:

 #### Data

 The `Data` folder usually contains:
 - `Configs/` — system and gameplay configuration files.
 - `Maps/` — tile-based map definitions and related metadata.
 - `Tilesets/` — tileset descriptions (how image tiles are interpreted and used).
 - `CommonFunctions/` — visual script graphs representing reusable logic blocks.

 These files are typically stored in JSON or binary formats that the editor and runtime both understand. You normally do not edit them by hand; you use the editor’s tools instead.

 #### Assets

 The `Assets` folder (or equivalent) holds the media the game actually displays and plays:
 - `Characters/` — sprites for actors, enemies, NPCs, and interactive objects.
 - `Tilesets/` — tileset images for environment and background construction.
 - `System/` — window skins, icons, and other UI graphics.
 - `Musics/` — background music tracks.
 - `Sounds/` — sound effects.
 - `Shaders/` — shader programs for transitions, tone adjustments, and special effects.
 - `Fonts/` — font files and associated license information.

 The editor does not modify these media files directly; instead, it references them from configuration and data files (for example, by relative path).

 #### Localization

 Projects that support multiple languages include localization data, typically under a locale-related folder. This data:
 - Maps text keys to localized strings in one or more languages.
 - Is used by both the editor UI and the runtime to display text in the desired language.

 You normally manage localization through dedicated tools or external editors, then place the resulting files where Ludork expects them.

 ### Creating a New Project

 When you create a new Project, you typically:
 - Choose an empty or existing folder to act as the project root.
 - Initialize the basic folder structure (`Data`, `Assets`, and any required subfolders).
 - Provide initial configuration files under `Data/Configs` (e.g., game title, resolution, fonts, shaders).

 After this, you can:
 - Create your first maps under `Data/Maps` using the map editor.
 - Define tilesets under `Data/Tilesets` and point them to images under `Assets/Tilesets`.
 - Author Common Functions as visual graphs under `Data/CommonFunctions`.

 The editor handles file creation and updates for you; your main responsibility is to choose a suitable project location and keep its contents under version control or backups if needed.

 ### Opening and Switching Projects

 To work on an existing Project:
 - Open the editor and select the folder that represents the project root.
 - The editor scans the expected subfolders, populating file lists and panels.
 - Maps, tilesets, configuration files, and Common Functions become available in the relevant tools.

 When you switch to another Project:
 - Close or switch away from the current Project in the editor.
 - Open the new project root, which replaces the previous one in the UI.

 It is a good habit to ensure your changes are saved before switching Projects.

 ### Saving Your Work

 As you edit content in different windows:
 - Each editor tracks whether its current document has unsaved changes.
 - When you save, the editor writes the updated data to the corresponding file under the Project root.

 Typical examples include:
 - Saving a map writes its layout and metadata into a file under `Data/Maps`.
 - Saving a tileset updates its definition under `Data/Tilesets`.
 - Saving a Common Function updates its visual script graph under `Data/CommonFunctions`.
 - Saving configuration changes writes updated values under `Data/Configs`.

 The runtime engine then reads these files the next time you run or preview the game.

 ### Working with Configs

 Configuration files define high-level behavior and defaults for your Project, such as:
 - Game window size and title.
 - Default fonts and font sizes.
 - Paths to shaders used for transitions and post-processing.
 - UI appearance options such as window skin and colors.

 You typically edit these through dedicated configuration windows in the editor. Behind the scenes:
 - The editor reads configuration data from files under `Data/Configs`.
 - When you change options and save, those files are updated.

 Consistent configuration is important: it ensures that maps, UI elements, and effects behave predictably across the entire Project.

 ### Working with Maps and Tilesets

 From a data perspective, maps and tilesets are tightly linked:
 - **Tilesets** describe how to interpret tileset images: tile size, collision or passability rules, and other properties.
 - **Maps** reference those tilesets and arrange tiles into playable areas.

 In practice:
 - Tileset definitions live under `Data/Tilesets` and reference images in `Assets/Tilesets`.
 - Map definitions live under `Data/Maps` and reference one or more tilesets.

 Editing these in the map and tileset tools:
 - Updates the corresponding data files under `Data`.
 - Does not duplicate image resources; instead, it keeps references to the files in `Assets`.

 This separation keeps your Project efficient and easier to maintain.

 ### Working with Common Functions

 Common Functions are stored as data assets under `Data/CommonFunctions` and represent reusable pieces of logic that can be invoked from different parts of your game.

 When you work with them:
 - You open a Common Function in the Node Graph editor.
 - The editor loads its graph from the corresponding file under `Data/CommonFunctions`.
 - You add or adjust nodes and connections to change how the logic behaves.
 - When you save, the modified graph is written back to the same file.

 The runtime engine loads these graph descriptions at startup or on demand and executes them as part of gameplay, using the same project data that the editor manipulates.

 ### Managing Assets

 Assets provide the visual and audio identity of your Project. To keep them manageable:
 - Group assets by type (characters, tilesets, system UI, music, sounds, shaders, fonts).
 - Use clear file names that describe their purpose, not just their origin.
 - Avoid moving or renaming assets without updating references in configuration or data files.

 In the editor:
 - Asset browsers and preview panels let you inspect images, audio, and shaders before using them.
 - Configuration and data editors let you assign specific assets to roles (for example, choosing a window skin or background music).

 Because the runtime uses the same asset paths as the editor, keeping your asset folders tidy and consistent reduces the chance of missing files or broken references when you run the game.
