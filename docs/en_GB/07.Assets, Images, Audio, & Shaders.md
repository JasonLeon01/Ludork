 # Ludork: 2D RPG Toolkit - Help Manual
 ## Assets: Images, Audio, Shaders

 This chapter describes how Ludork organizes and uses media assets: images, audio, shaders, and fonts. These assets give your Project its visual and audio identity and are referenced by maps, configuration files, and visual scripts.

 From a Project perspective:
 - Structured data lives under `Data/`.
 - Media assets live under an `Assets/` folder (or similar), grouped by type.

 The editor reads assets from these folders, lets you preview them, and helps you assign them to roles in your game.

 ### Images

 Images are used for characters, enemies, NPCs, tilesets, UI elements, and effects.

 Typical image subfolders include:
 - **Characters/** for actors, enemies, NPCs, and interactive objects.
 - **Tilesets/** for tileset images that maps use to build environments.
 - **System/** for window skins, icons, and other UI graphics.
 - **Animations/** for effect sheets such as spells, hits, and explosions.

 In the editor, you usually:
 - Browse these images via asset or file panels.
 - Preview them before assigning them to tilesets, animations, or configuration entries.
 - Reference them from data files (maps, tilesets, configs) by relative path.

 Maps and tilesets do not copy images; they store references to files in these folders. Changing an image file updates its appearance everywhere it is used.

 ### Audio

 Audio assets are split into background music and sound effects:
 - **Musics/** holds background tracks that play during maps, battles, or cutscenes.
 - **Sounds/** holds short sound effects (cursor, confirm, cancel, attack, item use, etc.).

 In practice:
 - Configuration files or gameplay logic decide which music or sound effect plays at a given time.
 - The editor provides ways to preview audio and assign specific files to events, UI actions, or map settings.

 As with images, audio files are referenced by path from configuration and data files, not embedded directly in them.

 ### Shaders

 Shaders are small programs that control how graphics are rendered. In Ludork, they are typically used for:
 - **Transitions** between scenes (fade, wipe, and other effects).
 - **Tone adjustments** such as color shifts or overall brightness changes.
 - **Material effects** that alter how objects are shaded.
 - **Post‑processing** such as grayscale effects.

 Shaders are usually stored under a **Shaders/** folder. The system configuration file (for example, `System.json` under `Data/Configs`) references key shader files, such as:
 - `transitionShaderPath`
 - `tilemapLightMaskShaderPath`
 - `lightMaskShaderPath`
 - `materialShaderPath`

 These fields specify which shader files the Project uses for transitions, materials, blur‑style effects, tone control, and grayscale rendering.

 In the editor, you can:
 - Preview shaders where supported.
 - Choose different shader files in configuration windows to change how transitions and effects look.

 ### Fonts

 Fonts define how text appears in your game. Font files are typically stored under a **Fonts/** folder and referenced from configuration files.

 A typical system configuration includes fields like:
 - `fonts` — a list of available font files, usually under `Fonts/`.
 - `fontSize` — a default size for in‑game text.

 In the editor, font and size are selected through configuration windows. Changing them affects text rendering throughout the game, including menus, dialogues, and UI labels.

 ### Asset Management Tips

 To keep your assets organized and easy to work with:
 - Group assets by purpose (characters, tilesets, UI, music, sounds, shaders, fonts).
 - Use descriptive file names that reflect the asset’s role in the game.
 - Avoid unnecessary duplication; reuse assets where appropriate.
 - Be careful when moving or renaming files: update any configuration or data entries that reference them.

 Because both the editor and runtime use the same asset paths, consistent organization reduces the chance of missing files or broken references when you run your game.
