 # Ludork: 2D RPG Toolkit - Help Manual
 ## Gameplay Systems Overview

 This chapter provides a high‑level overview of the core gameplay systems that Ludork exposes through its editor and runtime. It focuses on how different systems interact rather than on low‑level implementation details.

 The main systems include:
 - Game maps and navigation.
 - Actors and interactions.
 - Particles and visual effects.
 - Lights and environmental effects.

 ### Game Maps and Navigation

 Game maps define where gameplay happens:
 - They are built from tilesets and layers, as described in the tileset and map editing chapter.
 - They include passability information that determines where characters can move.
 - They may include regions, markers, or metadata for encounters and special rules.

 Pathfinding and navigation rely on:
 - The map’s tile grid and passability settings.
 - Cached data that accelerates collision and movement checks.

 As a creator, you mainly interact with this system by:
 - Designing map layouts.
 - Configuring which tiles are walkable or blocked in tilesets.
 - Placing regions or markers used by events and logic.

 ### Actors and Interactions

 Actors are entities that can appear on maps, such as:
 - Player characters and party members.
 - Enemies and NPCs.
 - Interactive objects like chests, switches, or doors.

 Actors are characterized by properties such as:
 - Position on the map.
 - Sprite or animation set.
 - Basic parameters (health, stats, or other gameplay attributes, depending on your project).

 Interactions between actors and the world are typically driven by:
 - Event logic and Common Functions.
 - Collisions with tiles or other actors.
 - Triggers such as entering a region, pressing a button, or completing a condition.

 The editor provides tools to place actors on maps and configure how they behave, though the exact panels may vary depending on your project setup.

 ### Particles and Visual Effects

 Particles are small, often short‑lived visual elements used to represent:
 - Magic spells and attacks.
 - Environmental effects such as embers, snow, or rain.
 - UI and feedback elements, like hit flashes or sparkles.

 The particle system:
 - Manages emission, lifetime, and movement of many small sprites.
 - Updates particle positions and states each frame.
 - Renders them on top of the scene according to their layer and blend mode.

 You typically configure particles by:
 - Selecting particle presets or definitions from data files.
 - Associating them with events, skills, or map triggers via visual scripting or configuration.

 ### Lights and Environmental Effects

 Lighting and environmental effects help define the mood of a scene. The lighting system supports:
 - Multiple light sources, each with position, color, and intensity.
 - Ambient or global light settings that affect the entire map.
 - Combinations of lights and shaders to create night scenes, caves, or dramatic highlights.

 In the editor, dedicated panels (such as a light configuration panel) let you:
 - Add, remove, and adjust light sources.
 - Save lighting setups as part of your map or configuration data.

 Environmental effects may also be driven by shaders, particle systems, or Common Functions, allowing you to blend visual and gameplay logic.

 ### Visual Scripting and Gameplay Logic

 The systems described above are tied together by visual scripting:
 - Common Functions can query and update map, actor, particle, or UI state.
 - Node Graphs can express conditional logic, such as starting a battle when entering a region or spawning particles when an attack hits.

 In practice:
 - You define data and configurations for maps, actors, particles, and lights.
 - You use Common Functions to decide when and how those systems respond to player input and game events.

 This separation between data, systems, and visual logic helps keep Projects flexible and easier to maintain.
