 # Ludork: 2D RPG Toolkit - Help Manual
 ## Testing & Running the Game

 This chapter explains how to test and run your game from within the Ludork editor. The goal is to help you quickly move between editing content and seeing how it behaves in the runtime.

 ### Previewing from the Editor

 The editor provides ways to preview your game without leaving the tool:
 - A **game view** inside the main window can show the game as the runtime engine would.
 - Play or preview commands (for example, toolbar buttons or menu items) start the game from a chosen entry point.

 A typical workflow is:
 - Edit maps, tilesets, Common Functions, and configuration.
 - Save your changes.
 - Use the preview command to run the game inside the editor.
 - Observe the result and return to editing as needed.

 Because the editor and runtime share the same data formats, changes can often be tested immediately after saving.

 ### Choosing a Start Point

 In most Projects, the game starts from a specific configuration:
 - A system configuration file may define the initial map or scene.
 - Additional configuration may specify the starting party, camera position, or UI state.

 When you run or preview the game:
 - The runtime engine reads these configuration values.
 - It loads the initial map, actors, and UI according to the Project’s data.

 To test different parts of the game, you can:
 - Temporarily change the starting map in configuration.
 - Use dedicated debug or warp functions (where provided) to jump to specific maps or scenes.

 ### Testing Maps and Interactions

 When focusing on a particular map or interaction, you can:
 - Open the map in the editor to adjust layout, tiles, and actors.
 - Run the game and move around to test passability, collisions, and region triggers.
 - Trigger events, Common Functions, and particles to verify that visual and gameplay effects behave as expected.

 If something does not work as intended:
 - Return to the editor, adjust the map, tileset, or visual script.
 - Save and re‑run to see the impact of your changes.

 This tight feedback loop is central to Ludork’s design.

 ### Using the Console and Logs

 The integrated console and logging tools are essential for understanding what happens at runtime:
 - Warnings can indicate missing assets or misconfigured paths.
 - Errors can highlight incorrect data or logic failures.
 - Informational messages can help you trace the flow of events and functions.

 During testing:
 - Keep the console visible while running the game.
 - Watch for repeated warnings or errors that might indicate deeper configuration issues.

 When a problem occurs, use the console messages to guide where to look in maps, configs, or Common Functions.

 ### Iteration Tips

 To make testing and iteration smoother:
 - Save frequently before running previews.
 - Focus on one feature or map at a time when debugging complex behavior.
 - Use small, incremental changes to visual scripts and configurations so it is easier to see what changed.

 Over time, you can establish your own workflow for when to preview, when to adjust maps or scripts, and when to move on to packaging and distribution.
