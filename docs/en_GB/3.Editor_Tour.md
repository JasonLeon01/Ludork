 # Ludork: 2D RPG Toolkit - Help Manual
 ## Editor Tour

 This chapter walks you through the Ludork editor interface from a user’s point of view. It does not cover every option in detail, but it should give you a clear mental model of where things live and how to move around the workspace.

 ### Main Window Layout

 When you launch the Ludork editor with a project open, you are presented with a main window composed of three broad areas:
 - A **top bar** with menus, mode toggles, and global actions.
 - A **central workspace** that shows the current map or other main content.
 - A set of **side and bottom panels** for project browsing, tools, and debugging.

 The exact arrangement can vary depending on which panels you have open, but the overall idea stays the same: the middle is where you edit, and the sides provide context and tools.

 ### Top Bar and Modes

 The top bar controls how you interact with your project:
 - **File and project actions** for opening, saving, and switching projects.
 - **Edit actions** such as undo, redo, and clipboard commands.
 - **Mode toggles** that switch between different editing focuses (for example, map editing versus runtime preview).
 - **Settings and configuration** entries that open dedicated windows for project options.

 Mode toggles are especially important:
 - In an **edit mode**, the central workspace behaves like a map editor, letting you paint tiles, select regions, and place objects.
 - In a **play or preview mode**, the workspace can switch to showing the game as it would appear in the runtime engine.

 You can think of the top bar as the “control panel” for the entire editor session.

 ### Central Workspace

 The central workspace is where you spend most of your time. In the default layout:
 - The **editor view** shows the current map or content you are editing.
 - A **scrollable area** lets you move around larger maps while keeping the window size manageable.
 - A **game view** can be used for embedded previews that resemble what the runtime engine will display.

 Within the workspace, you typically:
 - Zoom and pan the map or scene.
 - Select tile layers or editing tools.
 - Place, erase, or modify tiles and other objects.

 The workspace is designed to be focused and uncluttered so that maps and scenes remain the main thing you see.

 ### Project and File Panels

 Along one side of the main window you will usually find project‑oriented panels, such as:
 - A **File Explorer** that lists project files (maps, tilesets, common functions, configuration files, and other resources).
 - A **Preview panel** that shows a quick visual or textual preview of the currently selected file.

 Common tasks in these panels include:
 - Navigating to a map or tileset and opening it in the central workspace.
 - Selecting a configuration file to edit project‑wide settings.
 - Quickly previewing image, audio, or shader assets without leaving the editor.

 These panels help you keep track of the overall project structure while you focus on individual assets in the center.

 ### Map and Tileset Tools

 The map editing experience is organized around two related elements:
 - The **Tileset area**, where you choose which tile to paint with.
 - The **Map area**, where you apply those tiles to construct your scene.

 Typical interactions include:
 - Selecting a tileset from the project and viewing it in a dedicated tileset panel.
 - Picking a single tile or a region of tiles to use as a brush.
 - Painting, erasing, or filling tiles on the map.
 - Switching between tile layers (for example, ground, decorations, and overhead layers).

 The corresponding tileset editor provides more focused tools for:
 - Adjusting tileset properties such as tile size and passability.
 - Inspecting how tiles are laid out in source images.

 Together, these tools let you move quickly between editing the contents of a tileset and using that tileset to build maps.

 ### Common Functions and Node Graphs

 For visual scripting, the editor offers dedicated windows and panels for **Common Functions**:
 - A **Common Function list** that shows all available visual scripts in the project.
 - A **Node Graph canvas** where you arrange and connect nodes to define logic.
 - Supporting panels that help you manage inputs, outputs, and parameters.

 From the editor tour perspective, the most important aspects are:
 - You open a Common Function from the project list, which brings up the Node Graph editor window.
 - The Node Graph canvas behaves like a typical node-based editor: you drag nodes into the view, connect them with lines, and rearrange them for readability.
 - Changes you make here are saved into the project’s data and can be reused by other parts of your game.

 You can treat these windows as the “logic editors” of Ludork, standing alongside the map and tileset editors.

 ### Configuration and Settings Windows

 In addition to content editors, Ludork provides windows for configuring global and per‑project settings, including:
 - **System configuration**, where you define the game title, resolution, fonts, shaders, and other global options.
 - **Project settings**, where you adjust paths, default assets, or editor behavior.
 - Specialized panels such as lighting configuration, which let you fine‑tune how light behaves in your scenes.

 These windows usually appear as dialogs or secondary windows on top of the main editor. They are less frequently used than the map and tileset tools, but they have a large impact on how the game looks and feels.

 ### Console and Debug Panels

 To help you understand what is happening under the hood, the editor integrates:
 - A **Console panel** that shows log output, warnings, and errors.
 - **Toast notifications** that appear briefly to highlight important events, such as successful saves or error conditions.

 In everyday use, you might:
 - Watch the console when running previews to see if any assets are missing or configuration issues arise.
 - Use logs to debug behavior when a map or Common Function does not behave as expected.

 These panels are primarily diagnostic tools, but they are essential for tracking down problems without leaving the editor.

 ### Layout and Customization

 The editor uses a modern, material‑inspired theme and supports:
 - Resizable panels and splitters, so you can allocate more space to the areas you care about.
 - Persistent layout choices, so your preferred arrangement is remembered across sessions.

 Over time, you can customize:
 - Which panels are visible by default.
 - How much screen space is dedicated to the workspace versus project navigation or debugging.

 The goal is to adapt the interface to your workflow, whether you spend most of your time on maps, visual scripts, or configuration.

 ### Keyboard and Mouse Conventions

 While the exact shortcuts may vary by version, the editor broadly follows familiar desktop conventions:
 - **Ctrl/Cmd + Z / Y** for undo and redo.
 - **Ctrl/Cmd + C / V** for copy and paste in lists and editors that support it.
 - **Click‑and‑drag** to select tiles or move around node graphs.
 - **Mouse wheel** or dedicated controls for zooming, where supported.

 You can usually discover available shortcuts from menu entries and tooltips; this chapter focuses on the layout, but later chapters may call out specific shortcuts that are particularly useful for a given tool.
