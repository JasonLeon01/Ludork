# Ludork: 2D RPG Toolkit - Help Manual
## Introduction
Ludork is a comprehensive 2D RPG development toolkit built on PyQt5, designed to streamline the creation of role-playing games through a blend of an intuitive graphical editor and a lightweight, high-performance runtime engine. The runtime layer leverages SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) bindings via pybind11, ensuring efficient handling of rendering, audio, and input operations—core pillars of interactive 2D game development.

At its core, Ludork prioritizes rapid iteration and creator productivity, eliminating the need for constant context switching between editing tools and runtime testing. It combines visual scripting capabilities, robust asset management, and foundational gameplay systems to empower developers of all skill levels to build, iterate, and deploy 2D RPG content with minimal friction.

### Core Design Principles
- **Visual-First Workflow**: Replace manual code writing for core logic with a drag-and-drop Node Graph editor, enabling visual authoring of reusable game functions without deep programming expertise.
- **Editor-Runtime Parity**: Mirror editor data formats directly in the runtime engine, ensuring changes made in the editor translate instantly to in-game behavior, reducing iteration cycles.
- **Modular Architecture**: Separate, well-organized components for gameplay systems, UI rendering, asset management, and utility functions—making the toolkit extensible and easy to customize.
- **Performance Optimization**: Critical gameplay operations (e.g., tile map processing) are accelerated via C extensions, balancing the flexibility of Python with the speed of compiled code.

### Key Capabilities
Ludork equips developers with a full suite of tools to cover the entire 2D RPG creation pipeline:
- Visual Node Graph editor for authoring reusable Common Functions (powered by NodeGraphQt)
- Tileset and map editing with real-time preview, selection tools, and persistent `.dat` file storage
- Comprehensive asset browser and preview system for images, audio, shaders, and transition effects
- Built-in localization support and configuration management for multi-language, cross-environment deployment
- Material-themed, PyQt5-based UI with integrated console, toast notifications, and customizable widgets
- Lightweight SFML-powered runtime engine for seamless testing and deployment of game content

Whether you are prototyping a small-scale RPG, building a hobby project, or scaling up a more complex game, Ludork provides the foundational tools to focus on creative content rather than low-level engine implementation.
